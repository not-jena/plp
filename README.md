Introduction to my Personal Language Project!

In this repository I have PLP assignments 1-5 code and writeups and PLP 6 final project code.

My PLP 6 personal project idea was to make a music playlist!

Description: I am going to create a music playlist with a linked list data structure to store the songs in a playlist and pointers to navigate between songs. I will count the most popular genre of songs in the playlist and then recommend a new song to the user.

Major Components:

Define the Song structure with things like title, artist, and genre.

Implement the Playlist class with a linked list structure to store songs.

Add songs: a function to add my songs from a csv file to the linked list playlist

Display Songs: a function to display the list of songs in the playlist

Get Genre: a function to find the most popular genre in the list

Recommend song: a function to recommends a new song based on the most popular genre
